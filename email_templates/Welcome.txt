Welcome to Buildmate

As part of the Buildmate service we include the Buildmate Digest, an opt-in email service that allows you to receive advanced warnings of imminent project deadlines, such as estimates due to be returned or that are already overdue. To opt-in you'll need to tick "Receive email Notifications" from the Buildmate settings (https://buildmateapp.com/settings.aspx) page. To help prevent your Buildmate Digest defaulting to your email spam folder we recommend adding support@buildmateapp.com to your contact list.

If you do not wish to Opt-in please delete this email but avoid marking it as spam. If it has already been placed in your spam folder please transfer it to your inbox before deleting.

Getting Help
If you need any help you can use Buildmate’s built-in Support system (https://buildmateapp.com/support.aspx) where you can ask questions or request help. Alternatively you contact me directly by emailing steve@buildmateapp.com.

I pride myself on Buildmate being the only Estimating system that supports you personally. Please let me know if you have any feedback, I value, review and respond to all experiences and comments.

Steve,
Managing Director
