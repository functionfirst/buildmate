Introduction

Hi {FIRSTNAME},
Welcome to Buildmate, my name is Steve and I am the Managing Director of Buildmate. I wanted to get in touch to personally introduce myself and to make sure that everything is working out for you. If you need any help you can contact me personally by replying to this email or you can use Buildmate’s Support tool (http://buildmateapp.com/support/) where you can submit questions and get help.

In the meantime, if you have any feedback please let me know. I value and respond to all experiences and comments both positive and negative, especially if you feel you've had a negative experience so far. I pride myself that Buildmate is the only Estimating system that supports you personally, where the company is built around your success. If you feel Buildmate falls short of what you need I'd be more than happy to discuss how you think we can improve the system to make your life easier.

Thanks again,
Steve Jenkins,

Managing Director
